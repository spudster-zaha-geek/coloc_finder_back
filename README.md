To configure Django 5 in your project, install dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file, run migrations, and start the server, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment for your project (optional but recommended):
    ```
    python -m venv myenv
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```
      myenv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```
      source myenv/bin/activate
      ```

3. Install Django 5 and other dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run database migrations:
    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. Start the Django development server:
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

Make sure to replace `requirements.txt` with the actual path to your `requirements.txt` file.

Remember to periodically update your `requirements.txt` file as you add or update dependencies in your project.
